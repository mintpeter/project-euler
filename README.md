project-euler
=============

Programs written to solve problems at projecteuler.net.

I will solve ten problems in Scheme, then I will solve the same ten problems in Python. The goal of this project is to improve efficiency in Scheme and to become more familiar with Python as a second language in which I have dabbled before.

All Scheme programs will run with the Petite Scheme interpretor found at http://www.scheme.com/download/.

After solving 50 problems, I will attempt to solve the same 50 problems in a third language.
