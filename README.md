=============

Programs are written to solve problems at projecteuler.net.

Aside from the fact that these problems are super fun to solve, I like to use
Project Euler to get my feet wet with languages I've never used before. For
example, I've never written Perl before, so I solved some problems in Perl 6.
Listed below are the languages I want to play with sometime!

* [Ada](https://www.adacore.com/adaanswers/about/ada)?
* [Common Lisp](https://common-lisp.net/)
* [D](http://dlang.org/)
* [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/)
* [F#](http://fsharp.org/)
* [Forth](https://www.gnu.org/software/gforth/)
* [Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/)?
* [Go](https://golang.org/)
* [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
* [Lua](http://www.lua.org/)
* [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/)
* [Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org/)
* ~~[Perl 6](http://perl6.org/)~~
* [Prolog](http://www.gprolog.org/)
* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Smalltalk](http://squeak.org/)? (Squeak)
